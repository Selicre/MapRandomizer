<p><a href="https://version-10---sm-map-randomizer-544gn3gvwq-uc.a.run.app/">Version 10 (2022-12-21)</a>:
<ul>
<li>Replace the special behavior for Wrecked Ship introduced in version 9 with the following instead:
    <ul>
        <li>The Wrecked Ship Map Room and Wrecked Ship Save Room will always be in the same area as Phantoon's Room.
        <li>The area with Phantoon's Room will tend to be smaller than the other areas.
        <li><strong>Note</strong>: Phantoon's Room can once again be in any area, including Crateria.
    </ul>
<li>A new "-config.json" file is added to the returned ZIP, containing details about the version, random seed, and
    difficulty config used to generate the ROM.
</ul>

<p><a href="https://version-9---sm-map-randomizer-544gn3gvwq-uc.a.run.app/">Version 9 (2022-12-21)</a>:
<ul>
<li>Spread out the distribution of Save Room and Refill Rooms more evenly.
<li>Add special behavior for the Wrecked Ship area:
    <ul>
        <li>Phantoon's Room will always be in Wrecked Ship.
        <li>The Wrecked Ship Map Station will always be in Wrecked Ship.
        <li>Wrecked Ship will tend to be smaller than the other areas.
    </ul>
<li>Various corrections to the logic used for item placement (<a href="https://github.com/kjbranch/sm-json-data/compare/a544435..5339470">diff</a>).
</ul>

<p><a href="https://version-8---sm-map-randomizer-544gn3gvwq-uc.a.run.app/">Version 8 (2022-12-19)</a>:
<ul>
<li>Add blue door in Tourian Eye Door Room, removing Gadora graphics.
<li>Remove explosions & shaking in Tourian Escape rooms when not in escape sequence.
<li>Restore sandfall layouts to be more similar to vanilla game, with only minimal changes to ensure safe transitions.
<li>Remove the wall that spawned when entering Tourian Escape Room 1 from the right.
<li>Set up door-specific FX correctly (applicable when entering rooms through a certain door):
    <ul>
        <li>Rising Tide left door: lava rises
        <li>Volcano Room left door: lava rises and room is heated
        <li>Speed Booster Hall right door: lava rises if Speed Booster is collected (Note: only happens until completed
        once, and the lava will never rise or be high when entering from the left.)
        <li>Acid Statue Room bottom-right door: acid is lowered
        <li>Amphitheatre right door: acid is raised
        <li>Climb bottom-left door: disable door-specific FX from the vanilla game, to prevent the
            lava from rising when entering from Tourian Escape Room 4 (except during the escape).
    </ul>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://version-7---sm-map-randomizer-544gn3gvwq-uc.a.run.app/">Version 7 (2022-12-18)</a>:
<ul>
<li>Map station tiles are visible from the start of the game.
<li>Spoiler log is simplified; areas and a summary section are added.
<li>Fixed bug in West Ocean that caused Tripper graphics to be messed up and G4 statues sounds to play.
<li>Fix Wrecked Ship Save Room, which had a broken map instead of a usable save station (bug introduced in version 6).
<li>Minor graphical fixes to map: fix external wall in Lower Norfair Firefleas Room, and remove an item dot from
    Big Pink that wasn't supposed to be there.
</ul>

<p><a href="https://version-6---sm-map-randomizer-544gn3gvwq-uc.a.run.app/">Version 6 (2022-12-17)</a>:
<ul>
<li>Upper Tourian Save Room is replaced with a map station.
<li>Entering Tourian First Room no longer gives the area map.
<li>Each area gets exactly one map station.
<li>Cross-region arrow markers are added, becoming visible after getting the area map.
<li>Fixed a problem where the new tiles (e.g., the concentric square map tile) overwrote water graphics.
</ul>

<p><a href="https://version-5---sm-map-randomizer-544gn3gvwq-uc.a.run.app/">Version 5 (2022-12-16)</a>:
<ul>
<li>Fixed graphics after leaving Kraid.
<li>Unlocked camera in Spore Spawn Room so that entering from the right with Spore Spawn alive does not glitch the graphics.
<li>Fixed graphics when entering Shaktool Room from the right (before Shaktool finishes digging).
<li>Changes to make the in-game map more informative (more to come soon):
    <ul>
        <li>Refill stations (and the Ship) are marked by "+"-shaped tiles.
        <li>Map stations are marked by concentric square-shaped tiles.
        <li>G4 bosses and Mother Brain are marked by "X"-shaped tiles.
        <li>Items are consistently marked by a dot (and only tiles with an item have a dot).
        <li>Walls within a room are now consistently one pixel wide on the map.
        <li>Walls between rooms are now consistently two pixels wide on the map.
    </ul>
<li>Added a description of Open/Closed item placement, and a link to the new <a href="https://discord.gg/Gc99YV2ZcB">Discord</a> server.
</ul>

<p><a href="https://version-4---sm-map-randomizer-544gn3gvwq-uc.a.run.app/">Version 4 (2022-12-14)</a>:
<ul>
<li>Mother Brain rainbow beam no longer drains ammo (in case ammo is needed in the escape).
<li>Mother Brain is marked defeated after the Mother Brain fight, so that if the player re-enters Mother Brain room
    Mother Brain will not spawn again.
</ul>

<p><a href="https://version-3---sm-map-randomizer-544gn3gvwq-uc.a.run.app/">Version 3 (2022-12-14)</a>:
<ul>
<li>Stop Crateria map from getting messed up when save station is used.
<li>Skip map screens in file select. This was originally a temporary change for debugging the save map problem, but
    seemed worth keeping as a tiny quality-of-life change, making it faster to restart after resetting.
</ul>

<p><a href="https://version-2---sm-map-randomizer-544gn3gvwq-uc.a.run.app/">Version 2 (2022-12-13)</a>:
<ul>
<li>Fixed left door entrance to Crocomire Room and Mother Brain room.
<li>Disabled demo (which was broken).
</ul>

<p><a href="https://version-1---sm-map-randomizer-544gn3gvwq-uc.a.run.app/">Version 1 (2022-12-11)</a>:
<ul>
<li>Initial release
</ul>
