<p><a href="https://version-5---sm-map-randomizer-544gn3gvwq-uc.a.run.app/">Version 5 (2022-12-16)</a>:
<ul>
<li>Fixed graphics after leaving Kraid.
<li>Unlocked camera in Spore Spawn Room so that entering from the right with Spore Spawn alive does not glitch the graphics.
<li>Fixed graphics when entering Shaktool Room from the right (before Shaktool finishes digging).
<li>Changes to make the in-game map more informative (more to come soon):
    <ul>
        <li>Refill stations (and the Ship) are marked by "+"-shaped tiles.
        <li>Map stations are marked by concentric square-shaped tiles.
        <li>G4 bosses and Mother Brain are marked by "X"-shaped tiles.
        <li>Items are consistently marked by a dot (and only tiles with an item have a dot).
        <li>Walls within a room are now consistently one pixel wide on the map.
        <li>Walls between rooms are now consistently two pixels wide on the map.
    </ul>
<li>Added a description of Open/Closed item placement, and a link to the new <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1053421401354285129/1053421402096664628">Discord</a> server.
</ul>

<p><a href="https://version-4---sm-map-randomizer-544gn3gvwq-uc.a.run.app/">Version 4 (2022-12-14)</a>:
<ul>
<li>Mother Brain rainbow beam no longer drains ammo (in case ammo is needed in the escape).
<li>Mother Brain is marked defeated after the Mother Brain fight, so that if the player re-enters Mother Brain room
    Mother Brain will not spawn again.
</ul>

<p><a href="https://version-3---sm-map-randomizer-544gn3gvwq-uc.a.run.app/">Version 3 (2022-12-14)</a>:
<ul>
<li>Stop Crateria map from getting messed up when save station is used.
<li>Skip map screens in file select. This was originally a temporary change for debugging the save map problem, but
    seemed worth keeping as a tiny quality-of-life change, making it faster to restart after resetting.
</ul>

<p><a href="https://version-2---sm-map-randomizer-544gn3gvwq-uc.a.run.app/">Version 2 (2022-12-13)</a>:
<ul>
<li>Fixed left door entrance to Crocomire Room and Mother Brain room.
<li>Disabled demo (which was broken).
</ul>

<p><a href="https://version-1---sm-map-randomizer-544gn3gvwq-uc.a.run.app/">Version 1 (2022-12-11)</a>:
<ul>
<li>Initial release
</ul>
