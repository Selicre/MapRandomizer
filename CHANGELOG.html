<p><a href="https://version-4---sm-map-randomizer-544gn3gvwq-uc.a.run.app/">Version 4 (2022-12-14)</a>:
<ul>
<li>Mother Brain rainbow beam no longer drains ammo (in case ammo is needed in the escape).
<li>Mother Brain is marked defeated after the Mother Brain fight, so that if the player re-enters Mother Brain room
    Mother Brain will not spawn again.
</ul>

<p><a href="https://version-3---sm-map-randomizer-544gn3gvwq-uc.a.run.app/">Version 3 (2022-12-14)</a>:
<ul>
<li>Stop Crateria map from getting messed up when save station is used.
<li>Skip map screens in file select. This was originally a temporary change for debugging the save map problem, but
    seemed worth keeping as a tiny quality-of-life change, making it faster to restart after resetting.
</ul>

<p><a href="https://version-2---sm-map-randomizer-544gn3gvwq-uc.a.run.app/">Version 2 (2022-12-13)</a>:
