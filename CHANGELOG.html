<p><a href="https://version-18---sm-map-randomizer-544gn3gvwq-uc.a.run.app/">Version 18 (2022-12-29)</a>:
<ul>
<li>Improvements to map/mini-map:
    <ul>
        <li>Doors are shown as 2-pixel-wide openings (vs. as solid walls in vanilla).
        <li>False walls/passageways within rooms are shown as 4-pixel-wide openings (vs. as solid walls in vanilla).
    </ul>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://version-17---sm-map-randomizer-544gn3gvwq-uc.a.run.app/">Version 17 (2022-12-27)</a>:
<ul>
<li>Music is based on map area! (This causes some glitches with sound effects which can be fixed later.)
</ul>

<p><a href="https://version-16---sm-map-randomizer-544gn3gvwq-uc.a.run.app/">Version 16 (2022-12-26)</a>:
<ul>
<li>Tech is partially cleaned up and grouped by difficulty for easier navigation.
<li>Logic updates (<a href="https://github.com/kjbranch/sm-json-data/compare/5339470..6bef471cc81db2c857c619a29c1dff326215f992">diff</a>).
</ul>

<p><a href="https://version-15---sm-map-randomizer-544gn3gvwq-uc.a.run.app/">Version 15 (2022-12-26)</a>:
<ul>
<li>Refining the behavior introduced in version 10 on how Phantoon's Room is placed:
    <ul>
        <li>Phantoon's Room will always be two rooms away from the Wrecked Ship Map Room (which is as close as possible).
        <li>The Wrecked Ship Save Room will always be in the same area as Phantoon's Room and the Wrecked Ship Map Room.
        <li>These rooms no longer have any tendency to be in a smaller area.
        <li>They can still be in an area with any name, including possibly Crateria.
    </ul>
<li>Bugfix: Include Frog Savestation in the algorithm for balancing save stations.
<li>Include good farm rooms (those with 5x Gamet spawns) in the algorithm for balancing refills.
<li>Add "Map Rando" to the title screen.
</ul>

<p><a href="https://version-14---sm-map-randomizer-544gn3gvwq-uc.a.run.app/">Version 14 (2022-12-24)</a>:
<ul>
<li>With the rolling save functionality introduced in version 13, also advance the current save slot. This ensures
    that after a reset the default save slot to load will be the one most recently saved.
</ul>

<p><a href="https://version-13---sm-map-randomizer-544gn3gvwq-uc.a.run.app/">Version 13 (2022-12-23)</a>:
<ul>
<li>Supers now do double damage to Mother Brain 2.
<li>Saving at a different save station from the last save will advance to the next slot before saving (wrapping
    back to slot 1 if the last save was on slot 3).
<li>Fix graphical glitches that sometimes occurred when leaving Phantoon's Room before defeating Phantoon.
</ul>

<p><a href="https://version-12---sm-map-randomizer-544gn3gvwq-uc.a.run.app/">Version 12 (2022-12-23)</a>:
<ul>
<li>Fix an issue that caused new games (other than the first new game) to start at the wrong save location.
<li>Fix graphical glitches that sometimes occurred when leaving Crocomire's Room before defeating Crocomire.
</ul>

<p><a href="https://version-11---sm-map-randomizer-544gn3gvwq-uc.a.run.app/">Version 11 (2022-12-22)</a>:
<ul>
<li>Using a Missile Refill station refills all ammo types: Missiles, Supers, and Power Bombs.
<li>The current tile can be un-explored (i.e., turned back to black/blue on the map) by pressing Angle Up and Item Cancel
    simultaneously. To be effective, these inputs must be held while exiting the tile, since otherwise the game will
    immediately re-explore the tile.
<li>Max ammo is shown in the HUD.
<li>Restore rising acid in Tourian Escape Room 4 (unintentionally removed in version 8).
</ul>

<p><a href="https://version-10---sm-map-randomizer-544gn3gvwq-uc.a.run.app/">Version 10 (2022-12-21)</a>:
<ul>
<li>Replace the special behavior for Wrecked Ship introduced in version 9 with the following instead:
    <ul>
        <li>The Wrecked Ship Map Room and Wrecked Ship Save Room will always be in the same area as Phantoon's Room.
        <li>The area with Phantoon's Room will tend to be smaller than the other areas.
        <li><strong>Note</strong>: Phantoon's Room can once again be in any area, including Crateria.
    </ul>
<li>A new "-config.json" file is added to the returned ZIP, containing details about the version, random seed, and
    difficulty config used to generate the ROM.
</ul>

<p><a href="https://version-9---sm-map-randomizer-544gn3gvwq-uc.a.run.app/">Version 9 (2022-12-21)</a>:
<ul>
<li>Spread out the distribution of Save Room and Refill Rooms more evenly.
<li>Add special behavior for the Wrecked Ship area:
    <ul>
        <li>Phantoon's Room will always be in Wrecked Ship.
        <li>The Wrecked Ship Map Station will always be in Wrecked Ship.
        <li>Wrecked Ship will tend to be smaller than the other areas.
    </ul>
<li>Various corrections to the logic used for item placement (<a href="https://github.com/kjbranch/sm-json-data/compare/a544435..5339470">diff</a>).
</ul>

<p><a href="https://version-8---sm-map-randomizer-544gn3gvwq-uc.a.run.app/">Version 8 (2022-12-19)</a>:
<ul>
<li>Add blue door in Tourian Eye Door Room, removing Gadora graphics.
<li>Remove explosions & shaking in Tourian Escape rooms when not in escape sequence.
<li>Restore sandfall layouts to be more similar to vanilla game, with only minimal changes to ensure safe transitions.
<li>Remove the wall that spawned when entering Tourian Escape Room 1 from the right.
<li>Set up door-specific FX correctly (applicable when entering rooms through a certain door):
    <ul>
        <li>Rising Tide left door: lava rises
        <li>Volcano Room left door: lava rises and room is heated
        <li>Speed Booster Hall right door: lava rises if Speed Booster is collected (Note: only happens until completed
        once, and the lava will never rise or be high when entering from the left.)
        <li>Acid Statue Room bottom-right door: acid is lowered
        <li>Amphitheatre right door: acid is raised
        <li>Climb bottom-left door: disable door-specific FX from the vanilla game, to prevent the
            lava from rising when entering from Tourian Escape Room 4 (except during the escape).
    </ul>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://version-7---sm-map-randomizer-544gn3gvwq-uc.a.run.app/">Version 7 (2022-12-18)</a>:
<ul>
<li>Map station tiles are visible from the start of the game.
<li>Spoiler log is simplified; areas and a summary section are added.
<li>Fixed bug in West Ocean that caused Tripper graphics to be messed up and G4 statues sounds to play.
<li>Fix Wrecked Ship Save Room, which had a broken map instead of a usable save station (bug introduced in version 6).
<li>Minor graphical fixes to map: fix external wall in Lower Norfair Firefleas Room, and remove an item dot from
    Big Pink that wasn't supposed to be there.
</ul>

<p><a href="https://version-6---sm-map-randomizer-544gn3gvwq-uc.a.run.app/">Version 6 (2022-12-17)</a>:
<ul>
<li>Upper Tourian Save Room is replaced with a map station.
<li>Entering Tourian First Room no longer gives the area map.
<li>Each area gets exactly one map station.
<li>Cross-region arrow markers are added, becoming visible after getting the area map.
<li>Fixed a problem where the new tiles (e.g., the concentric square map tile) overwrote water graphics.
</ul>

<p><a href="https://version-5---sm-map-randomizer-544gn3gvwq-uc.a.run.app/">Version 5 (2022-12-16)</a>:
<ul>
<li>Fixed graphics after leaving Kraid.
<li>Unlocked camera in Spore Spawn Room so that entering from the right with Spore Spawn alive does not glitch the graphics.
<li>Fixed graphics when entering Shaktool Room from the right (before Shaktool finishes digging).
<li>Changes to make the in-game map more informative (more to come soon):
    <ul>
        <li>Refill stations (and the Ship) are marked by "+"-shaped tiles.
        <li>Map stations are marked by concentric square-shaped tiles.
        <li>G4 bosses and Mother Brain are marked by "X"-shaped tiles.
        <li>Items are consistently marked by a dot (and only tiles with an item have a dot).
        <li>Walls within a room are now consistently one pixel wide on the map.
        <li>Walls between rooms are now consistently two pixels wide on the map.
    </ul>
<li>Added a description of Open/Closed item placement, and a link to the new <a href="https://discord.gg/Gc99YV2ZcB">Discord</a> server.
</ul>

<p><a href="https://version-4---sm-map-randomizer-544gn3gvwq-uc.a.run.app/">Version 4 (2022-12-14)</a>:
<ul>
<li>Mother Brain rainbow beam no longer drains ammo (in case ammo is needed in the escape).
<li>Mother Brain is marked defeated after the Mother Brain fight, so that if the player re-enters Mother Brain room
    Mother Brain will not spawn again.
</ul>

<p><a href="https://version-3---sm-map-randomizer-544gn3gvwq-uc.a.run.app/">Version 3 (2022-12-14)</a>:
<ul>
<li>Stop Crateria map from getting messed up when save station is used.
<li>Skip map screens in file select. This was originally a temporary change for debugging the save map problem, but
    seemed worth keeping as a tiny quality-of-life change, making it faster to restart after resetting.
</ul>

<p><a href="https://version-2---sm-map-randomizer-544gn3gvwq-uc.a.run.app/">Version 2 (2022-12-13)</a>:
<ul>
<li>Fixed left door entrance to Crocomire Room and Mother Brain room.
<li>Disabled demo (which was broken).
</ul>

<p><a href="https://version-1---sm-map-randomizer-544gn3gvwq-uc.a.run.app/">Version 1 (2022-12-11)</a>:
<ul>
<li>Initial release
</ul>
