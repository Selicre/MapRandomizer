TODO:
- put phantoon's room in a tight cluster with broken map & save.
- add strat for jumping over fune with no damage (check osse Twitch clip).
- update ammo refilled message box.
- consider putting map stations closer to the ship? (still balanced to one per area)
- try using music based on area
- shorten mother brain 1 death cutscene? (remove flashing?)
- open escape door when reentering mother brain room from right with mother brain dead.
- organize tech on website.
- despawn enemies to reduce lag during escape (at least in some rooms)?
- L + R + Select + Start to reset?
- consider alternative item placement strategy:
  - prefer placing item at locations where you can get back (so the player doesn't have to take a leap of faith as much)
- skip map select after game over
- fix fake gray door graphics in Kraid room, Phantoon room
- rework item placement to clean up, and so Big Pink isn't so stacked
  - use alternative fallback strategy (cumulative sequence) instead of placing random item.
- display doors on map?
- fix bug where wrong tiles sometimes show at top of pause-menu map
- implement enemyKill in logic
- rework item config:
  - extra axis for ammo openness
  - add middle setting
- turn Crateria scrolling sky back on. Update values for the 14 doors here: https://patrickjohnston.org/bank/8F#fB76A.
- figure out race condition between fastdoors and Mother Brain room setup. Maybe code around $80836F could be used
  to wait?
- fix tiles below Warehouse Entrance
- fix new game on second file (or after deleting first file)
- fix internal checksum in output ROM
- Warn if base ROM checksum does not match vanilla.
- Find some way to handle Baby metroid drain.
  - One idea (probably bad): when the tech for baby skip is disabled, stop the camera lock so the player can run straight through without
    getting drained?
  - Deal with it correctly in the item logic
  - Possibly shorten the cutscene for quality of life (since it might be necessary to traverse it multiple times)
- change boss room doors: let the door you enter be blue but opposite door be locked by boss?
  - first make boss fight strats more accurate in the logic.
- clean up the code everywhere
- add README
    - make
- title graphics
  - title
     - sprites GFX: $95:80D8 ("Super Metroid" graphics, "Nintendo", etc.):
         - bank pointer to sprite GFX at $8B:9295
         - word pointer to sprite GFX at $8B:9299
         - copied to VRAM $6000..7FFF
     - spritemap: $8C:879D (also $8C:833D but this is unused)?
         - free space at $8C:F760
         - (2-byte) pointer to spritemap: $8B:A0C5
         - Description of spritemap format: $A9:93EE
     - uses screen mode 7 during title
          - only BG layer is BG1 (as always for mode 7).
          - OAM base: VRAM 0xC000  (sprite GFX for "Super Metroid" title)
     - normally mode 1 elsewhere
  - title BG GFX: $94:E000 (0xA6000)
  - title BG tilemap: $96:FC04 (0xB7C04)
- take shinespark health requirements into account properly
- redo the front-end.
  - make it so client can save presets.
- fix timestamps in zip file
- detect client hang-up and abort (probably requires switching to websocket request)
- fix new game on second file: some data comes from other file?
- fix map when using elevators (to set tiles to explored)
- cross-area transitions
  - to fix graphical glitches (look into using special GFX flag?)
- balance boss distribution (one boss per area, corresponding to vanilla?)
- fix suit graphics not showing after getting suit (consequence of skipping animation)?
- show map text for cross-area transitions?
- increase PB drop rates on farms?
